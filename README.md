# BetterAIMod_1.18.2

As much as the name of this project may suggest, this project is less to do with AI and more to add features that me and my friends wanted that seemed to be in line with the "vanilla experience".
This includes copper as a usable material as well as void quartz as a new endgame material as well as maybe a new boss following the ender dragon?
